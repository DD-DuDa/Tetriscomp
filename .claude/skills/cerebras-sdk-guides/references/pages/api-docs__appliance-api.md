SDK Appliance API Reference
¶

This section presents the SDK Appliance API reference for running SDK
programs on a Cerebras Wafer-Scale Cluster (WSC).

See
Running SDK on a Wafer-Scale Cluster
 for an introduction to running in appliance mode
on a Wafer-Scale Cluster.

SdkCompiler
¶

Python API for compiling SDK programs on a Cerebras Wafer-Scale Cluster.

class

cerebras.sdk.client.
SdkCompiler
(
**
kwargs
)
¶

Bases:
object

Manages the generation of compile artifacts on a Cerebras Wafer-Scale
Cluster using the CSL compiler.

SdkCompiler
 must be used via a context manager.

Keyword Arguments

mgmt_namespace
 (
str
) –
Appliance cluster namespace to which the job is submitted. Default is
the default namespace.

resource_cpu
 (
int
) –
CPU cores on the WSC management node used by the compile job in units
of 1/1000 CPU (default: 24000, or 24 cores)

resource_mem
 (
int
) –
Memory in bytes requested from the management node for the compile job
(default:
64

<<

30
, or 64 GiB)

disable_version_check
 (
bool
) – If
True
, ignore version
differences between appliance client and server

Example
:

In the following example, an
SdkCompiler
 object is instantiated
via a context manager.
The
SdkCompiler.compile()
 function takes four arguments:

the directory containing the CSL code files,

the name of the top level CSL code file that contains the layout block,

the compiler arguments,

and the output directory or output file for the compile artifacts.

import

json

from

cerebras.sdk.client

import

SdkCompiler

# Instantiate compiler using a context manager

with

SdkCompiler
(
disable_version_check
=
True
)

as

compiler
:

# Launch compile job

artifact_path

=

compiler
.
compile
(

"."
,

"layout.csl"
,

"--fabric-dims=8,3 --fabric-offsets=4,1 --memcpy --channels=1 -o out"
,

"."

)

# Write the artifact_path to a JSON file

with

open
(
"artifact_path.json"
,

"w"
,

encoding
=
"utf8"
)

as

f
:

json
.
dump
({
"artifact_path"
:

artifact_path
,},

f
)

compile
(
codedir
:

str
,
layout
:

str
,
args
:

str
,
outdir
:

str
)
 →
str
¶

Generates compile artifacts using the CSL compiler.

Parameters

codedir
 (
str
) – Directory containing CSL code files.

layout
 (
str
) – Top-level CSL file containing the layout block.

args
 (
str
) – Arguments passed to the CSL compiler.

outdir
 (
str
) – Output directory or file for compile artifacts.

Returns

String containing local path to compile artifacts.

Return type

str

SdkLauncher
¶

class

cerebras.sdk.client.
SdkLauncher
(
artifact_path
:

str
,
**
kwargs
)
¶

Bases:
object

The SdkLauncher API can be used to upload artifacts, run custom commands in
the appliance, and use custom scripts written as if the system was not in
appliance mode and the user were running directly from a worker node.

The user must use the
%CMADDR%
 template string to pass the system address
to a run script.

Parameters

artifact_path
 (
str
) – Path to a compiled artifact which will be transferred.
and extracted in the appliance.

Keyword Arguments

simulator
 (
bool
) –
If
True
, runs the program on the simulator using a worker node of
the Wafer-Scale Cluster.
Default value is
False
, i.e., allocates and runs on a WSE.

mgmt_namespace
 (
str
) –
Appliance cluster namespace to which the job is submitted. Default is
the default namespace.

resource_cpu
 (
int
) –
CPU cores on the WSC management node used by the compile job in units
of 1/1000 CPU (default: 24000, or 24 cores)

resource_mem
 (
int
) –
Memory in bytes requested from the management node for the compile job
(default:
64

<<

30
, or 64 GiB)

disable_version_check
 (
bool
) – If
True
, ignore version
differences between appliance client and server

Example
:

In the following example, an
SdkLauncher
 object is instantiated via a
context manager, with path to compile artifacts given by
artifact_path
.

launcher.stage
 transfers an additional file
additional_artifact.txt

to the appliance. Next,
launcher.run
 runs a command on the appliance
worker node which writes the contents of that file to stdout.
We then use
launcher.run
 to run a host Python script
run.py
.
Notice that we specify the system’s CM address passed to this script via
the template string
%CMADDR
, which will be evaluated at runtime based
on the system allocated to this job. We then use
download_artifact

to transfer a file back from the appliance.

import

json

import

os

from

cerebras.sdk.client

import

SdkLauncher

# read the compile artifact_path from the json file

with

open
(
"artifact_path.json"
,

"r"
,

encoding
=
"utf8"
)

as

f
:

data

=

json
.
load
(
f
)

artifact_path

=

data
[
"artifact_path"
]

# artifact_path contains the path to the compiled artifact.

# It will be transferred and extracted in the appliance.

# The extracted directory will be the working directory.

# Set simulator=False if running on CS system within appliance.

with

SdkLauncher
(
artifact_path
,

simulator
=
False
,

disable_version_check
=
True
)

as

launcher
:

# Transfer an additional file to the appliance,

# then write contents to stdout on appliance

launcher
.
stage
(
"additional_artifact.txt"
)

response

=

launcher
.
run
(

"echo
\"
ABOUT TO RUN IN THE APPLIANCE
\"
"
,

"cat additional_artifact.txt"
,

)

print
(
"Test response: "
,

response
)

# Run the original host code as-is on the appliance,

# using the same cmd as when using the Singularity container

response

=

launcher
.
run
(
"cs_python run.py --name out --cmaddr %CMADDR%"
)

print
(
"Host code execution response: "
,

response
)

# Fetch files from the appliance

launcher
.
download_artifact
(
"out.txt"
,

"./output_dir/out.txt"
)

download_artifact
(
artifact_name
:

str
,
out_path
:

str
)
 →
str
¶

Downloads an artifact from the appliance. If the artifact is a directory,
a tarball of that directory will be created and transferred.

Parameters

artifact_name
 (
str
) – Name of the artifact to download.

out_path
 (
str
) – Top-level CSL file containing the layout block.

Returns

The name of the file that has been written (can contain a
.tar.gz

extension if the
artifact_name
 was a directory.)

Return type

str

stage(artifact_path:

str):

Stages additional artifacts in the remote working directory within the appliance.

Parameters

artifact_path
 (
str
) – Local path to the artifact to be staged on the appliance.

run
(
*
commands
)
¶

Run one or more shell commands on the appliance.

Parameters

*commands
 – One or more command strings. Use the special placeholder

%CMADDR%
 wherever a CS system address should be
substituted.
All
 positional arguments must be strings.

SdkRuntime
¶

Note

The
SdkRuntime
 appliance bindings are deprecated. Use
SdkLauncher
 to
wrap an SDK host Python script instead.

class

cerebras.sdk.client.
SdkRuntime
(
artifact_path
:

str
,
**
kwargs
)
¶

Bases:
object

Manages the execution of SDK programs on the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Cluster
appliance. The constructor analyzes the WSE ELFs in the
bindir

and prepares the WSE or simfabric for a run.

SdkRuntime
 must be used via a context manager.

Parameters

artifact_path
 (
str
) – Path to ELF files compiled by
SdkCompiler
.
The runtime collects the I/O and fabric parameters
automatically, including height, width, number of
channels, width of buffers,… etc.

Keyword Arguments

simulator
 (
bool
) –
If
True
, runs the program on simulator using a worker node of
the Wafer-Scale Cluster.
Default value is
False
, i.e., allocates and runs on a WSE.

mgmt_namespace
 (
str
) –
Appliance cluster namespace to which the job is submitted. Default is
the default namespace.

resource_cpu
 (
int
) –
CPU cores on the WSC management node used by the compile job in units
of 1/1000 CPU (default: 24000, or 24 cores)

resource_mem
 (
int
) –
Memory in bytes requested from the management node for the compile job
(default:
64

<<

30
, or 64 GiB)

disable_version_check
 (
bool
) – If
True
, ignore version
differences between appliance client and server

Example
:

In the following example, an
SdkRuntime
 runner object is instantiated
via a context manager, with path to compile artifacts given by

artifact_path
. The compiled kernel code has exported symbols

my_fn
, which names a function defined on all PEs in the program, and

A
, which points to an array on all PEs. The context manager loads and
starts the program. Then, the function
my_fn
 is launched. After this
function is launched,
A
 on the device is copied back into
data

on the host.
