GEMV Tutorial 6: Routes and Fabric DSDs
¶

Now that we’ve introduced multiple PEs into our program,
instead of duplicating our GEMV problem between them,
let’s actually distribute the work for computing a single GEMV.

Learning objectives
¶

After completing this tutorial, you should know how to:

Use fabric DSDs
fabout_dsd
 and
fabin_dsd
 to send and receive data between PEs

Utilize asynchronous builtin operations on fabric DSDs

Define a local task which is activated by a
local_task_id

Example overview
¶

Our program will run on two processing elements (PE).

We will demonstrate the program with a simulated fabric
consisting of a 9 x 3 block of PEs.

The program will first copy
b
 into the left PE’s
y
 array.
Then, it will copy the left half of
A
’s columns into the left PE,
and the right half of
A
’s columns into the right PE.
Similarly, it will copy the the first
N/2
 elements of
x

into the left PE, and the last
N/2
 elements of
x
 into the right PE.

Each PE will then compute
A*x
 for its local pieces of
A
 and
x
.
Thus, both PEs perform a matrix-vector product for an
M

x

N/2
 matrix.
The PEs will increment their local
y
 arrays by this result.

The left PE then sends its
y
 array to the right PE, and the right PE
increments its local
y
 array by the received values.
Because the left
y
 array contained the contribution from
b
,
the final summed
y
 on the right PE is our GEMV result.

The host then copies
y
 off of the right PE.

Problem Steps
¶

Visually, this program consists of the following steps:

1. Host copies b into y array of left PE.

2. Host copies left N/2 columns of A to left PE, right N/2 columns to right PE.

3. Host copies first N/2 elements of x to left PE, last N/2 elements to right PE.

4. Host launches function to compute GEMV.

5. Each PE increments local y by local portion of matrix-vector product Ax.

6. Left PE sends local y to right PE, and right PE increments y by received values.

6. Right PE now contains final result y. Host copies back y from right PE.

Writing the CSL
¶

What do we need to modify in our layout to distribute our GEMV
between two PEs?

We need to define several new parameters for our two PE programs.
This includes a
pe_id
, used to differentiate between the
left and right PEs, and a color, which will be used to route
data between the PEs.

We need to set the color configuration on both PEs for the color
that will be used to send the left PE’s
y
 array to the
right PE.

Let’s take a look at our new
layout.csl
, included below.

// matrix dimensions on each PE

param
 M:
i16
;

param
 N:
i16
;

// Colors

const
 send_color:
color

=

@get_color
(
0
);
// Color used to send/recv data between PEs

// This example only uses 2 PEs

const
 memcpy
=

@import_module
(
"<memcpy/get_params>"
, .{
  .width
=

2
,
  .height
=

1
,
});

layout
 {

// PE coordinates are (column, row)

@set_rectangle
(
2
,
1
);

// Left PE (0, 0)

@set_tile_code
(
0
,
0
,
"pe_program.csl"
, .{
    .memcpy_params
=
 memcpy.get_params(
0
),
    .M
=
 M,
    .N_per_PE
=
 N
/

2
,
    .pe_id
=

0
,
    .send_color
=
 send_color
  });

// Left PE sends its result to the right

@set_color_config
(
0
,
0
, send_color, .{.routes
=
 .{ .rx
=
 .{
RAMP
}, .tx
=
 .{
EAST
} }});

// Right PE (1, 0)

@set_tile_code
(
1
,
0
,
"pe_program.csl"
, .{
    .memcpy_params
=
 memcpy.get_params(
1
),
    .M
=
 M,
    .N_per_PE
=
 N
/

2
,
    .pe_id
=

1
,
    .send_color
=
 send_color
  });

// Right PE receives result of left PE

@set_color_config
(
1
,
0
, send_color, .{.routes
=
 .{ .rx
=
 .{
WEST
}, .tx
=
 .{
RAMP
} }});

// export symbol names

@export_name
(
"A"
,
[*]
f32
,
true
);

@export_name
(
"x"
,
[*]
f32
,
true
);

@export_name
(
"y"
,
[*]
f32
,
true
);

@export_name
(
"compute"
,
fn
()
void
);
}

We have two
@set_tile_code
 calls, one for the left PE (0, 0),
and one for the right PE (1, 0).
Both PEs take a new parameter,
N_per_PE
, equal to
N

/

2
.
This is the number of columns of
A
 that each PE will receive
and operate on.
Both PEs also receive as a parameter a
pe_id
: the left PE
has
pe_id
 0, and the right PE has
pe_id
 1.
We’ll see in
pe_program.csl
 how we use
pe_id
 to parameterize
the behavior of the program.

We also have two
@set_color_config
 calls, to set the configuration
of
send_color
 on each PE:

@set_color_config
(
0
,
0
, send_color, .{.routes
=
 .{ .rx
=
 .{
RAMP
}, .tx
=
 .{
EAST
} }});
...

@set_color_config
(
1
,
0
, send_color, .{.routes
=
 .{ .rx
=
 .{
WEST
}, .tx
=
 .{
RAMP
} }});

The router of each PE has five directions:
RAMP
,
NORTH
,
SOUTH
,
EAST
,
WEST
.
The cardinal directions refer to the routers of neighboring PEs:

NORTH
 is the PE directly above our PE, and so on.

RAMP
 refers to the connection between our PE’s router and its compute element (CE).
When setting a route for a color on a given PE, the receive
rx
 and transmit
tx
 fields
are from the perspective of the router.
Thus, receiving form the
RAMP
 means that our compute element is sending data up to the
fabric, where it can then be transmitted across the fabric.

For the left PE (0, 0),
send_color
 will send up the PE’s
RAMP
 to the fabric, and then
transmit data to the
EAST
.
For the right PE (1, 0),
send_color
 will receive data from the
WEST
 on the fabric
(i.e., from the left PE), and then transmit it down the
RAMP
 to its compute element.

Now let’s take a look at our new
pe_program.csl
, included below.

@export_symbol

@export_symbol

@export_symbol

}

In addition to our new parameters
N_per_PE
,
pe_id
, and
send_color
,
we also introduce
exit_task_id
, our first value of type
local_task_id
.
We’ll talk about its use a bit later.

The
A
 array now has size
M*N_per_PE
 instead of
M*N
, since each PE
only stores half the columns.
To make our data transfer easier, we also now store
A
 column-major instead
of row-major.
Notice that
A_dsd
 now accesses
M
 contiguous elements, instead of
M

elements strided by the row size, since we now store column-major.

Our
gemv
 function operates almost identically to before, except we only loop
over
N_per_PE
 columns instead of
N
 columns.
Since
A
 is now column-major,
@increment_dsd_offset
 must increment
by the length of an entire column instead of by one element.
Note that on the left PE,
y
 already contains the elements of
b
 before

gemv
 executes.

Fabric DSDs and async operations
¶

The
compute
 function, which is called from the host, first calls
gemv

to compute the local contribution to
y
 on each PE.
Then, the left PE calls
send_right
, while the right PE calls
recv_left
.

send_left
 defines a
fabout_dsd
, which is used to send wavelets to the
fabric along the color
send_color
.
Note that we give this
fabout_dsd
 the extent
M
, since we intend to send
the
M
 elements of
y
 along the fabric.
The
@fmovs
 operation copies the
M
 elements accessed by
y_dsd

into
out_dsd
.
The
.async

=

true
 field makes this operation asynchronous.
The
.activate
 field specifies a
local_task_id
 to activate when this
operation completes.
When this operation completes,
exit_task_id
 will be activated.

recv_right
 defines a
fabin_dsd
 to receive the wavelets sent along

send_color
.
The
@fadds
 operation here increments the right PE’s
y_dsd
 by the
elements received in
in_dsd
.
Thus, after this operation,
y_dsd
 contains our final GEMV result.
This builtin also executes asynchronously, and actives
exit_task_id

when complete.

Warning

Whenever using fabric DSDs in builtin operations, always make these operations
execute asynchronously.
Using fabric DSDs synchronously can result in poor performance or deadlocks.

Tasks and activatable task IDs
¶

Now, what does activating
exit_task_id
 do?
In the comptime block, the
@bind_local_task
 builtin binds
exit_task_id

to the task
exit_task
.
When
exit_task_id
 is activated,
exit_task
, which unblocks the
memcpy

command stream, executes.
This task must execute on both PEs before control is returned to the host.

Writing the host code
¶

Our new host code must:

Copy
b
 into the left PE’s
y
 array

Copy the left halves of
A
 and
x
 to the left PE, and the right halves to the right PE

After the device kernel completes, copy
y
 back from the right PE

We explain some features of our new
run.py
 below.

Copying
b
 into

 of left PE
¶

We copy
b
 into
y
 of the left PE here:

runner

memcpy_h2d
(
y_symbol
,

b
,

0
,

0
,

order
=
MemcpyOrder
.
ROW_MAJOR
,

data_type
=
MemcpyDataType
.
MEMCPY_32BIT
,

nonblock
=
False
)

Notice that the ROI is a single PE, located at (0, 0) in the program rectangle.
The right PE (1, 0) is omitted from this
memcpy
 call.

Copying
A
 and
x
¶

We copy
A
 and
x
 to the device as follows:

runner
.
memcpy_h2d
(
A_symbol
,

A
.
transpose
()
.
ravel
(),

0
,

0
,

2
,

1
,

M
*
N_per_PE
,

streaming
=
False
,

order
=
MemcpyOrder
.
ROW_MAJOR
,

data_type
=
MemcpyDataType
.
MEMCPY_32BIT
,

nonblock
=
False
)

runner
.
memcpy_h2d
(
x_symbol
,

x
,

0
,

0
,

2
,

1
,

N_per_PE
,

streaming
=
False
,

order
=
MemcpyOrder
.
ROW_MAJOR
,

data_type
=
MemcpyDataType
.
MEMCPY_32BIT
,

nonblock
=
False
)

Notice that the ROI is now both PEs, so the
memcpy
 calls copy data into
both the left and right PE.

Because we now store
A
 column-major on the PEs, we transpose our
A

matrix, and then flatten it to a 1D array with
ravel()
.
Each PE gets
M*N_per_PE
 elements, so each PE gets
N_per_PE
 columms
of
A
.

Similarly, each PE gets
N_per_PE
 elements of
x
.

Copying back result
¶

We copy back
y
 from the right PE as follows:

y_result

=

np
.
zeros
([
M
],

dtype
=
np
.
float32
)

runner
.
memcpy_d2h
(
y_result
,

y_symbol
,

1
,

0
,

1
,

1
,

M
,

streaming
=
False
,

order
=
MemcpyOrder
.
ROW_MAJOR
,

data_type
=
MemcpyDataType
.
MEMCPY_32BIT
,

nonblock
=
False
)

Notice that our ROI now begins at (1, 0), and contains a single PE.
Thus, this
memcpy
 call copies back the
M
 elements of
y

only from the right PE.

Once this call is complete, we then, as in our previous tutorials,
check that the received result is correct.

Compiling and running the program
¶

Since this program only uses two PEs, we adjust our
simulated fabric dimensions accordingly:

$ cslc layout.csl --fabric-dims
=
9
,3 --fabric-offsets
=
4
,1 --params
=
M:4,N:6 --memcpy --channels
=
1
 -o out
$ cs_python run.py --name out

We use the same command to run.
You should see a
SUCCESS!
 message at the end of execution.

Exercises
¶

Instead of using two PEs along the same row to compute this GEMV,
try using two PEs along the same column.
