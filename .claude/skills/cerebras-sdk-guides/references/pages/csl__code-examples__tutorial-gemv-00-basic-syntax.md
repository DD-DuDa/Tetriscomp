GEMV 0: Basic CSL Syntax
¶

This example is the first in a series of successive example programs
demonstrating CSL and the SDK by implementing a general matrix-vector product,
or GEMV.

We start by illustrating the syntax of some of CSL’s core language constructs.
The code in this example is not a complete program, but it shows
some of the most commonly used CSL features.

CSL’s syntax is like that of
Zig
.
Despite the similarity, both the purpose and the implementation of the CSL
compiler are different from that of the Zig compiler.

Types
¶

CSL includes some basic types:

bool
 for boolean values

i16
 and
i32
 for 16- and 32-bit signed integers

u16
 and
u32
 for 16- and 32-bit unsigned integers

f16
 and
f32
 for 16- and 32-bit IEEE-754 floating point numbers

In addition to the above, CSL also supports array types and pointer types.
Their use will be illustrated in subsequent examples.

Functions
¶

Functions are declared using the
fn
 keyword.  The compiler provides special
functions called
Builtins
, whose names start with
@
 and whose
implementation is provided by the compiler.  All CSL builtins are described in

Builtins
.

Conditional Statements and Loops
¶

CSL includes
if
 statements and
while
 and
for
 loops.
These are described in greater detail in the subsequent example programs.

Note

See
GEMV Tutorial 0: Basic CSL Syntax
 for a step-by-step walkthrough
of this example.

// Not a complete program; we include it here for illustrating some syntax

// Every variable must be declared either "const" or "var"

// Const cannot be modified after declaration, but var can

// Constants defining dimensions of our matrix
