GEMV Tutorial 3: Memcpy
¶

We’ve already written a program that launches a kernel and
copies the result back to the host, so lets extend this to
copying the initial tensors from the host to the device.

This program will now have three phases:

Host-to-device memcpy of
A
,
x
, and
b

Kernel launch

Device-to-host memcpy of
y

Learning objectives
¶

After completing this tutorial, you should know how to:

Copy data from host to device using
SdkRuntime
’s
memcpy_h2d
 function

Example overview
¶

Our program will run on a single processing element (PE).
Like the previous tutorials, we will demonstrate the program
with a simulated fabric consisting of an 8 x 3 block of PEs.

Our problem steps are nearly identical to the previous
tutorials, except we now copy
A
,
x
, and
b
 to the
device after initializing them on the host.

pe_program.csl
 no longer needs to initialize
A
,
x
,
and
b
, but both CSL files will need to be updated to
export symbols for these tensors.
The host code will need to introduce three
memcpy_h2d

calls to copy the tensors to the device.

Problem Steps
¶

Visually, this program consists of the following steps:

1. Host copies A, x, b to device.

2. Host launches function to compute y.

3. Host copies result y from device.

Modifying the CSL
¶

Our previous tutorials initialized
A
,
x
, and
b
 on device
before computing GEMV.
What else do we need for our device code to support a host-to-device
memcpy of
A
,
x
, and
b
, so that we need only initialize
them on the host?

We need our layout file to export the symbol names for
A
,
x
,
and
b
.

We need our PE program to export pointers to
A
,
x
, and
b
.
The PE program no longer needs to initialize these tensors.

We include the new
layout.csl
 below, and highlight the changes.

const
 memcpy
=

@import_module
(
"<memcpy/get_params>"
, .{ .width
=

1
, .height
=

1
 });

layout
 {

@set_rectangle
(
1
,
1
);

@set_tile_code
(
0
,
0
,
"pe_program.csl"
, .{ .memcpy_params
=
 memcpy.get_params(
0
) });

// export symbol names

@export_name
(
"A"
,
[*]
f32
,
true
);

@export_name
(
"x"
,
[*]
f32
,
true
);

@export_name
(
"b"
,
[*]
f32
,
true
);

@export_name
(
"y"
,
[*]
f32
,
false
);

@export_name
(
"init_and_compute"
,
fn
()
void
);
}

As described previously,
@export_name
 makes symbol names visible
to the host program.

Notice that we now have
@export_name
 calls for
A
,
x
, and
b
.
Unlike
y
, the mutability of these symbols is set to
true
,
since the host will write to these symbols.

Now let’s take a look at
pe_program.csl
.

param
 memcpy_params;

// memcpy module provides infrastructure for copying data

// and launching functions from the host

const
 sys_mod
=

@import_module
(
"<memcpy/memcpy>"
, memcpy_params);

// Constants definining dimensions of our matrix

const
 M:
i16

=

4
;

const
 N:
i16

=

6
;

// 48 kB of global memory contain A, x, b, y

var
 A:
[
M
*
N
]
f32
;
// A is stored row major

var
 x:
[
N
]
f32
;

var
 b:
[
M
]
f32
;

var
 y
=

@zeros
(
[
M
]
f32
);
// Initialize y to zero

// DSDs for accessing A, b, y

// A_dsd accesses column of A

var
 A_dsd
=

@get_dsd
(mem1d_dsd, .{ .tensor_access
=
 |i|{M}
-
> A
[
i
*
N
]
 });

var
 b_dsd
=

@get_dsd
(mem1d_dsd, .{ .base_address
=

&
b, .extent
=
 M });

var
 y_dsd
=

@get_dsd
(mem1d_dsd, .{ .base_address
=

&
y, .extent
=
 M });

// ptrs to A, x, b, y will be advertised as symbols to host

var
 A_ptr:
[*]
f32

=

&
A;

var
 x_ptr:
[*]
f32

=

&
x;

var
 b_ptr:
[*]
f32

=

&
b;

const
 y_ptr:
[*]
f32

=

&
y;

// Compute gemv

fn
 gemv()
void
 {

// Loop over all columns of A

for
 (
@range
(
i16
, N)) |i| {

// Calculate contribution to A*x from ith column of A, ith elem of x

@fmacs
(y_dsd, y_dsd, A_dsd, x
[
i
]
);

// Move A_dsd to next column of A

    A_dsd
=

@increment_dsd_offset
(A_dsd,
1
,
f32
);
  }

// Add b to A*x

@fadds
(y_dsd, y_dsd, b_dsd);
}

// Call initialize and gemv functions

fn
 init_and_compute()
void
 {
  gemv();
  sys_mod.unblock_cmd_stream();
}

comptime
 {

@export_symbol
(A_ptr,
"A"
);

@export_symbol
(x_ptr,
"x"
);

@export_symbol
(b_ptr,
"b"
);

@export_symbol
(y_ptr,
"y"
);

@export_symbol
(init_and_compute);
}

Notice that we no longer need an
initialize
 function.
When
init_and_compute
 is called, we assume
A
,
x
, and
b

have already been initialized.

We additionally now define pointers
A_ptr
,
x_ptr
, and
b_ptr

to
A
,
x
, and
b
, respectively.
These pointers are exported with
@export_symbol
,
so that they will be visible to the host.

Modifying the host code
¶

The host code is largely similar to the previous tutorials, except
we now must copy
A
,
x
, and
b
 to the device after
initializing them on the host.
We do this with
memcpy_h2d
, which has similar syntax to
the previously introduced
memcpy_d2h
.

We include our modified
run.py
 below.

)

These calls have quite a few arguments, but they’re identical to those
used by
memcpy_d2h
, other than the first two.
For
memcpy_h2d
, the first argument is the symbol on device that
points to the array to which you want to copy.
The next argument is the
numpy
 array from which you are copying.
Note that the arrays passed to memcpy must be 1D.

See
GEMV Tutorial 1: A Complete Program
 for an explanation of the remaining
arguments.

Compiling and running the program
¶

As with the previous tutorial, we compile and run this code using:

$ cslc layout.csl --fabric-dims
=
8
,3 --fabric-offsets
=
4
,1 --memcpy --channels
=
1
 -o out
$ cs_python run.py --name out

You should see a
SUCCESS!
 message at the end of execution.

Exercises
¶

Try initializing
A
,
x
, and
b
 to other values.
Modify the host code to do multiple matrix-vector products:
Try using your output
y
 from a matrix-vector product
as your input
x
 to another matrix-vector product.

Next
¶

In the next tutorial, we expand this program to use
data structure descriptors (DSDs), a core language feature of CSL.
