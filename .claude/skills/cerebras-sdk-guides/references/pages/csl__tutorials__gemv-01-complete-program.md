GEMV Tutorial 1: A Complete Program
¶

Now that we’ve shown the basic syntax of writing a GEMV in CSL,
let’s create a complete program which you can compile and run
on the fabric simulator or a real Cerebras system.

Note

We refer to the simulator or real system as the “device,”
and the CPU from which programs are launched the “host.”
We also often refer to functions which run on the device as
“device kernels.”

Learning objectives
¶

After completing this tutorial, you should know how to:

Write and compile a full CSL program with CSL’s
memcpy
 infrastructure

Write a host program in Python using the
SdkRuntime
 host runtime

Launch a device kernel using
SdkRuntime
’s RPC launch mechanism

Copy data from device to host using
SdkRuntime
’s
memcpy_d2h
 function

Example overview
¶

Our program will run on a single processing element (PE).

We will demonstrate the program with a simulated fabric
consisting of an 8 x 3 block of PEs.

Warning

The coordinates of PEs are always specified (column, row). The dimensions
of a grid of PEs are specified (width, height), or, equivalently,
(number of columns, number of rows).

Problem Steps
¶

Visually, this program consists of the following steps:

1. Host launches function on PE.

2. Function initializes A, x, b, and computes y.

3. Host copies result y from device.

Writing the CSL
¶

In the previous tutorial, we declared arrays and wrote functions

initialize
 and
gemv
 to initialize and compute
y

=

Ax

+

b
.
What else do we need for our device code to form a complete program?

We need a top-level “layout” file, which will define the program
rectangle on which our kernel will run, and assign a
code file to the single PE in our rectangle.

We need to initialize the infrastructure of the memcpy library,
which allows the host to launch kernels and copy data to and
from the device.

We first walk through
layout.csl
, which defines our program layout.
We include this code below.

// Import memcpy layout module for 1 x 1 grid of PEs

// This module defines parameters passed to program on the single PE

const
 memcpy
=

@import_module
(
"<memcpy/get_params>"
, .{ .width
=

1
, .height
=

1
 });

layout
 {

// Use just one 1 PE (columns=1, rows=1)

@set_rectangle
(
1
,
1
);

// The lone PE in this program should execute the code in "pe_program.csl"

// We pass memcpy parameters as a parameter to the program. Note that

// memcpy parameters are parameterized by the PE's column number.

@set_tile_code
(
0
,
0
,
"pe_program.csl"
, .{ .memcpy_params
=
 memcpy.get_params(
0
) });

// Export device symbol for array "y"

// Last argument is mutability: host can read y, but not write to it

@export_name
(
"y"
,
[*]
f32
,
false
);

// Export host-callable device function

@export_name
(
"init_and_compute"
,
fn
()
void
);
}

Initializing memcpy infrastructure
¶

At the very top of this file is an
@import_module
 call,
which imports the top-level memcpy infrastructure.
This module import requires width and height parameters
which correspond to the dimensions of the program rectangle.
This program only uses a single PE, so width and height are
both 1.

Module imports in CSL act like unique struct types.
Thus, the code in the CSL standard library file
memcpy/get_params

can be used like a struct named
memcpy
.

Defining layout
¶

The layout block is evaluated at compile time.
We use it to define the number of PEs used in our program
and assign code to each of those PEs.

@set_rectangle
 defines the shape of our program.
Because our program will run on a single PE,
we are compiling this program for a 1x1 rectangle of PEs.

Our single PE has coordinate (0,0), and we assign to it the code file

pe_program.csl
, which we will explore later.
We also pass some parameters related to memcpy to this program.

The
memcpy
 struct contains a function named
get_params
,
which returns some parameters for the memcpy infrastructure that each
PE’s code file must include.
This function takes as an argument the column number of the PE;
thus, for this program, the appropriate parameters are returned by

memcpy.get_params(0)
.

Exporting symbols
¶

Our host program will directly launch a device kernel, and copy back
the result
y
.
The two
@export_name
 calls make the symbols visible to the host
program.

The first
@export_name
 call makes the symbol named
y
 visible
to the host, as a pointer to an array of type
f32
.
Its mutability is set to
false
, meaning that the host can only
read from and not write to the symbol.

The second
@export_name
 call makes the symbol
init_and_compute

visible to the host; this is the function which we will launch from
the host to compute the GEMV.
This function takes no arguments, so its type is
fn()void
.

Adding memcpy to the PE program
¶

Now, let’s take a look at
pe_program.csl
, which defines the code
that we assign to our single PE.
This program is largely the same as the preceding tutorial’s
code.csl

file, but with some additional infrastructure related to
memcpy
.

// Struct containing parameters for memcpy layout

param
 memcpy_params;

// memcpy module provides infrastructure for copying data

// and launching functions from the host

const
 sys_mod
=

@import_module
(
"<memcpy/memcpy>"
, memcpy_params);

// Constants definining dimensions of our matrix

const
 M:
i16

=

4
;

const
 N:
i16

=

6
;

// 48 kB of global memory contain A, x, b, y

var
 A:
[
M
*
N
]
f32
;
// A is stored row major

var
 x:
[
N
]
f32
;

var
 b:
[
M
]
f32
;

var
 y:
[
M
]
f32
;

// Ptr to y will be exported as symbol to host

// Ptr is const, so host can read but not write to y

const
 y_ptr:
[*]
f32

=

&
y;

// Initialize matrix and vectors

fn
 initialize()
void
 {

// for loop with range syntax

for
 (
@range
(
i16
, M
*
N)) |idx| {
    A
[
idx
]

=

@as
(
f32
, idx);
  }

for
 (
@range
(
i16
, N)) |j| {
    x
[
j
]

=

1.0
;
  }

// while loop with iterator syntax

var
 i:
i16

=

0
;

while
 (i < M) : (i
+=

1
) {
    b
[
i
]

=

2.0
;
    y
[
i
]

=

0.0
;
  }
}

// Compute gemv

fn
 gemv()
void
 {

for
 (
@range
(
i16
, M)) |i| {

var
 tmp:
f32

=

0.0
;

for
 (
@range
(
i16
, N)) |j| {
      tmp
+=
 A
[
i
*
N
+
 j
]

*
 x
[
j
]
;
    }
    y
[
i
]

=
 tmp
+
 b
[
i
]
;
  }
}

// Call initialize and gemv functions

fn
 init_and_compute()
void
 {
  initialize();
  gemv();

// After this function finishes, memcpy's cmd_stream must

// be unblocked on all PEs for further memcpy commands

// to execute

  sys_mod.unblock_cmd_stream();
}

comptime
 {

// Export symbol pointing to y so it is host-readable

@export_symbol
(y_ptr,
"y"
);

// Export function so it is host-callable by RPC mechanism

@export_symbol
(init_and_compute);
}

At the top, we declare a parameter named
memcpy_params
:
this parameter’s value is set at compile time by
@set_tile_code

in
layout.csl
.

Next is another memcpy-related
@import_module
, this time importing
the PE-specific
<memcpy/memcpy>
 standard library file
as a struct named
sys_mod
.

Our functions
initialize
 and
gemv
 are identical to the previous
tutorial.
However, note one addition to
init_and_compute
.
After
gemv
 finishes, we must notify the memcpy infrastructure that
additional commands from the host can proceed.
Thus, we must call
sys_mod.unblock_cmd_stream()
 at the end
of our function.
The control flow of every host-callable function in a CSL program must end
with a call to
unblock_cmd_stream()
.

Everything inside of
comptime
 block is evaluated at compile time.
This comptime block exports symbols so they can be advertised to the host.
In particular,
y_ptr
, which is a pointer to the array
y
,
is exported with the name
y
.
The
init_and_compute
 function is also exported.

Compiling CSL code
¶

We compile this code for the CS-2 simulator using:

$ cslc layout.csl --fabric-dims
=
8
,3 --fabric-offsets
=
4
,1 --memcpy --channels
=
1
 -o out

This command will produce multiple ELF files, in a directory named
out
.
Let’s walk through several aspects of this command.

First, we specify the top level file to be compiled, in this case

layout.csl
.

pe_program.csl
 does not have to be specified in the compilation command,
because it is included by
layout.csl
.

We also must specify the fabric dimensions of our target device,
and the fabric offset at which we place our program.
As we specified above, this tutorial is using an 8 x 3 simulated fabric,
and we place the program’s lone PE at column 4, row 1 of the fabric.

Warning

Every program using memcpy
must
 use a fabric offset of
4,1
,
and if compiling for a simulated fabric, must use a fabric dimension
of at least
width+7,height+1
, where
width
 and
height
 are
the dimensions of the program.
These additional PEs are used by memcpy to route data on and off the wafer.

Last, note that flag specifying
memcpy
 and
channels
.
Every program using memcpy must include the
--memcpy
 flag.
When running on a real system,
the
channels
 flag determines the max throughput for transferring data
on and off the wafer.
Its value can be no larger than the width of the program rectangle,
and maxes out at 16.
Typically, performance improvements are minimal past 8 channels.

This program is also compatible with the CS-3 architecture.
We can specify the
--arch
 flag to determine for which architecture we compile.
The default value is
--arch=wse2
,
where WSE-2 is the processor architecture used in the CS-2.
We specify the value
--arch=wse3
 to compile for WSE-3,
the processor architecture used in the CS-3.

Writing the host code
¶

What does our host code need to do?

Import needed libraries

Specify paths to compiled code and instantiate runner object

Run device kernel
init_and_compute

Copy back
y
 and check result

We explain some features of our
run.py
 file containing
the host code below.

Imports
¶

SdkRuntime
 is the library containing the functionality necessary
for loading and running the device code, as well as copying
data on and off the wafer.

Along with
SdkRuntime
, we import
MemcpyDataType
 and
MemcpyOrder
,
which are enums containing types for use with memcpy calls.
We explain this in more detail below.

Instantiating runner
¶

This script contains two arguments:
name
 and
cmaddr
.
We use
name
 to specify the directory containing the compilation output.
We will discuss
cmaddr
 later, but for now, we leave it unspecified.

We instantiate a runner object using
SdkRuntime
’s constructor:

runner

=

SdkRuntime
(
args
.
name
,

cmaddr
=
args
.
cmaddr
)

We then load the program onto the device and begin running with

runner.load()
 and
runner.run()
.

We also grab a handle for later copying
y
 off the device,
with the call to
runner.get_id('y')
.

Running device kernel
¶

Next, we launch our device kernel
init_and_compute
:

runner
.
launch
(
'init_and_compute'
,

nonblock
=
False
)

The
nonblock=False
 flag simply specifies that this call will wait to
return control to the host program until after the kernel has been launched.
Otherwise, this call will return control to the host immediately.

Copying back result
¶

We use a call to
memcpy_d2h
 to copy the result
y
 back from the device.
First, we must allocate space on the host to hold the result:

y_result

=

np
.
zeros
([
1
*
1
*
M
],

dtype
=
np
.
float32
)

Then, we copy
y
 from the device into this array:

runner
.
memcpy_d2h
(
y_result
,

y_symbol
,

0
,

0
,

1
,

1
,

M
,

streaming
=
False
,

order
=
MemcpyOrder
.
ROW_MAJOR
,

data_type
=
MemcpyDataType
.
MEMCPY_32BIT
,

nonblock
=
False
)

This call has quite a few arguments, so let’s walk through them.
The first argument is the array on the host to hold the result,
which we just allocated on the previous line.
The next argument,
y_symbol
, is the symbol on device that points
to the
y
 array.

The next four arguments specify the location of the rectangle of PEs from
which to copy, which is referred to as the “region of interest” or ROI.
The first two,
0,

0
, specify that the northwest corner of the ROI
begins at PE (0, 0) within the program rectangle.
Thus, it begins at the northwesternmost corner of the program rectangle.

The next two specify the width and height of the ROI.
We only copy the result back from a single PE, so the width and height
of our ROI is simply
1,

1
.

Warning

Note that we specify the ROI based on its position in the
program rectangle, NOT on its position in the device fabric.

The next argument specifies how many elements to copy back from each
PE in the ROI.
In this case, the result
y
 has
M
 elements.

The next four arguments are all keyword arguments specifying certain attributes
of this copy operation.
We’ll defer discussion of the
streaming
 keyword to a future tutorial.
Note, however, that any copy between host-to-device which copies to or from
a device symbol uses
streaming=False
.

The
order
 keyword specifies the layout of the data copied back to

y_result
.

memcpy_d2h
 always copies into a 1D array on the host.

ROW_MAJOR
 specifies that the data is ordered by (ROI height, ROI width,
elements per PE).
Thus, the data copied back from each PE is contiguous in the result array.

COLUMN_MAJOR
, on the other hand, specifies that the data is ordered by
(elements per PE, ROI width, ROI height).
Thus, the result array will contain the 0th element from each PE,
followed by the 1st element from each PE, and so on.

For this tutorial, because we are copying back from a single PE,
ROW_MAJOR

and
COLUMN_MAJOR
 are identical.
In general, for copies over larger fabrics,
COLUMN_MAJOR
 is more
performant than
ROW_MAJOR
.

The
data_type
 keyword specifies the width of the data copied back.
We are copying back single-precision floating point numbers,
so the data width is 32 bit.

nonblock=False
 specifies that this call will not return control
to the host until the copy into
y_result
 has finished.

Note

How does the program ensure that this copy does not happen until

init_and_compute
 has finished?
The memcpy infrastructure in the CSL program can only execute one
command at a time.
After a device kernel is launched,
unblock_cmd_stream
 must be called
before a
memcpy_d2h
 can proceed.
The call to
unblock_cmd_stream
 at the end of the
init_and_compute

function in
pe_program.csl
 guarantees that
init_and_compute

finishes before the
memcpy_d2h
 occurs.

Finishing program and checking result
¶

The call to
runner.stop()
 stops the execution of the program on device.

We then check that the
y_result
 we copied back from the device matches
the
y_expected
 we pre-computed on the host.
If they indeed match, we print a
SUCCESS
 message.

Running the program
¶

We can run the program using
cs_python
,
which wraps the Cerebras-provided Python instance for executing host code.

$ cs_python run.py --name out

You should see a
SUCCESS!
 message at the end of execution.
You have successfully run your first program!

Moving from simulator to system
¶

We’ve compiled and run this program using the fabric simulator,
but with a few modest changes, we can also compile and run on a real
Cerebras system.

First, we must modify the compile command to replace the
fabric-dims

with the actual dimensions of our target fabric.
Most CS-3s will have a fabric dimension of 762 x 1172,
so our compile command becomes:

$ cslc layout.csl --arch
=
wse3 --fabric-dims
=
762
,1172 --fabric-offsets
=
4
,1 --memcpy --channels
=
1
 -o out

This program is also compatible with the CS-2, which has a fabric dimension
of 757 x 996. Compiling for the CS-2 requires specifying the WSE-2 architecture:

$ cslc layout.csl --arch
=
wse2 --fabric-dims
=
757
,996 --fabric-offsets
=
4
,1 --memcpy --channels
=
1
 -o out

The Cerebras system is a network attached accelerator.
When targeting a real system for running a program,
we must know its IP address.
This is the purpose of the
SdkRuntime
 constructor’s

cmaddr
 keyword argument.

If the IP address is stored in an environment variable
named
$CS_IP_ADDR
, then you can run on the system with:

$ cs_python run.py --name out --cmaddr
$CS_IP_ADDR
:9000

We use port 9000 to connect to the system and launch our program.

Note

The compile and run commands above are used when running the SDK directly from a host node
connected to the CS system. If using a Wafer-Scale Cluster in appliance mode,
see
Running SDK on a Wafer-Scale Cluster
.

Exercises
¶

We initialize
A
,
x
, and
b
 on the host to the same values
we initialize them on the device, manually.

Instead of initializing them like this, we could also use
memcpy_d2h

calls to copy them from the device just as we do with
y
.
Create exported symbols for
A
,
x
, and
b
, and use them to
copy these arrays back to the host and compute an expected result for
y
.

Note that
A
,
x
, and
b
 are not initialized until the

init_and_compute
 device kernel executes.
We can also break up
init_and_compute
 into two device kernel calls.
Create separate device kernel calls for
initialize
 and
gemv

which are launched separately on the host,
and copy back
A
,
x
, and
b
 after you launch
initialize

but before you launch
gemv
.

Next
¶

In the next tutorial, we expand this program to use
data structure descriptors (DSDs), a core language feature of CSL.
