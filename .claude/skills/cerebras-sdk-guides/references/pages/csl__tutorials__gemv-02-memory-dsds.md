GEMV Tutorial 2: Memory DSDs
¶

Now that we’ve written a complete program, let’s introduce
a central concept in CSL: memory Data Structure Descriptors (DSDs).
Memory DSDs provide an efficient mechanism for performing operations
on entire tensors.

Learning objectives
¶

After completing this tutorial, you should know how to:

Define memory DSDs for tensor accesses

Use memory DSDs in builtin operations on tensors

Use builtins to initialize tensors

Example overview
¶

Our program will run on a single processing element (PE).
Like the previous tutorial, we will demonstrate the program
with a simulated fabric consisting of an 8 x 3 block of PEs.

Our problem steps are identical to the previous tutorial.
Our layout file, host code, and compile and run commands
are also identical.
We only need to modify
pe_program.csl
, and we’ll take
a closer look at changes to this file.

Modifying the CSL
¶

In the previous tutorial, we created a complete CSL program using a
single PE to initialize and compute
y

=

Ax

+

b
.
What do we need to do in
pe_program.csl
 to take advantage of
memory DSDs and builtin operations on tensors?

We need to define DSDs for accessing our tensors

We need to rewrite the
gemv
 function to operate on these DSDs

We previously walked through
layout.csl
, which is the same for
this tutorial as the previous one.
We include the new
pe_program.csl
 below, and highlight the
changes in this code.

param
 memcpy_params;

// memcpy module provides infrastructure for copying data

// and launching functions from the host

const
 sys_mod
=

@import_module
(
"<memcpy/memcpy>"
, memcpy_params);

// Constants definining dimensions of our matrix

const
 M:
i16

=

4
;

const
 N:
i16

=

6
;

// 48 kB of global memory contain A, x, b, y

var
 A:
[
M
*
N
]
f32
;
// A is stored row major

// Initialize x, b, y using builtins

var
 x
=

@constants
(
[
N
]
f32
,
1.0
);

var
 b
=

@constants
(
[
M
]
f32
,
2.0
);

var
 y
=

@zeros
(
[
M
]
f32
);

// DSDs for accessing A, b, y

// b_dsd uses tensor access expression to specify access to M consecutive elements of b

var
 b_dsd
=

@get_dsd
(mem1d_dsd, .{ .tensor_access
=
 |i|{M}
-
> b
[
i
]
 });

// The above expression is equivalent to:

// var b_dsd = @get_dsd(mem1d_dsd, .{ .base_address = &b, .extent = M });

// y_dsd uses base_address and extent fields to specify access to M consecutive elements of y

var
 y_dsd
=

@get_dsd
(mem1d_dsd, .{ .base_address
=

&
y, .extent
=
 M });

// The above expression is equivalent to:

// var y_dsd = @get_dsd(mem1d_dsd, .{ .tensor_access = |i|{M} -> y[i] });

// A_dsd accesses column of A

// A_dsd uses tensor access expression to specify access to every Nth element of A

var
 A_dsd
=

@get_dsd
(mem1d_dsd, .{ .tensor_access
=
 |i|{M}
-
> A
[
i
*
N
]
 });

// The above expression is equivalent to:

// var A_dsd = @get_dsd(mem1d_dsd, .{ .base_address = &A, .extent = M, .stride = N });

// ptr to y will be advertised as symbol to host

const
 y_ptr:
[*]
f32

=

&
y;

// Initialize A matrix

fn
 initialize()
void
 {

// for loop with range syntax

for
 (
@range
(
i16
, M
*
N)) |idx| {
    A
[
idx
]

=

@as
(
f32
, idx);
  }
}

// Compute gemv

fn
 gemv()
void
 {

// Loop over all columns of A

  }

(y_dsd, y_dsd, b_dsd);
}

  sys_mod.unblock_cmd_stream();
}

comptime
 {

@export_symbol
(y_ptr,
"y"
);

@export_symbol
(init_and_compute);
}

Defining our memory DSDs
¶

First, let’s take a look at the DSDs we define for accessing
b
 and
y
:

var
 b_dsd
=

@get_dsd
(mem1d_dsd, .{ .tensor_access
=
 |i|{M}
-
> b
[
i
]
 });

var
 y_dsd
=

@get_dsd
(mem1d_dsd, .{ .tensor_access
=
 |i|{M}
-
> y
[
i
]
 });

b_dsd
 and
y_dsd
 are the memory DSDs for
accessing
b
, and
y
, respectively.

The
tensor_access
 field defines the access pattern of these DSDs.

|i|
 specifies the induction variable, and
{M}
 specifies
the loop bound; i.e., these DSDs will access
M
 elements.
After
->
, an expression is given for accessing a memory location
using the induction variable.
This expression must be
affine
, or linear plus a constant.

The access pattern for these DSDs is straightforward: these DSDs
loop over all
M
 elements, in order, of their respective tensors.

Now let’s take a look at the DSD for accessing
A
:

var
 A_dsd
=

@get_dsd
(mem1d_dsd, .{ .tensor_access
=
 |i|{M}
-
> A
[
i
*
N
]
 });

This DSD accesses
M
 elements of
A
, but strided by
N
 elements;
i.e.,
A_dsd
 accesses elements
0,

N,

2*N,

...

(M-1)*N
.
Because
A
 is stored in row major format, this means that
A_dsd

as defined here accesses the 0th column of
A
.

Note

These memory DSDs are of type
mem1d_dsd
, which are one-dimensional
memory DSDs. CSL also provides
mem4d_dsd
, multidimensional memory
DSDs for up to four dimensions.

You can learn more about memory DSDs in our language reference guide

Data Structure Descriptors
.

Using our DSDs to compute GEMV
¶

Now that we’ve defined our DSDs, let’s take a look at how to use them to
compute GEMV.

Recall that our previous
gemv()
 function was defined as follows:

fn
 gemv()
void
 {

for
 (
@range
(
i16
, M)) |i| {

var
 tmp:
f32

=

0.0
;

for
 (
@range
(
i16
, N)) |j| {
      tmp
+=
 A
[
i
*
N
+
 j
]

*
 x
[
j
]
;
    }
    y
[
i
]

=
 tmp
+
 b
[
i
]
;
  }
}

Now, our
gemv()
 looks like this:

fn
 gemv()
void
 {

for
 (
@range
(
u16
, N)) |i| {

@fmacs
(y_dsd, y_dsd, A_dsd, x
[
i
]
);
    A_dsd
=

@increment_dsd_offset
(A_dsd,
1
,
f32
);
  }

@fadds
(y_dsd, y_dsd, b_dsd);
}

Notice that we now only have one explicit loop over
N
,
instead of two explicit loops.
At each iteration, this
@fmacs
 operation does the following:

performs a vector-scalar multiplication between the column of
A

referenced by
A_dsd
 and the scalar
x[i]
,

performs an elementwise vector addition between this result and
the vector
y
,

and stores this final result into
y
.

Thus, each
@fmacs
 operation increments the
M
 elements of
y

by the vector-scalar product of column
i
 of
A

and element
i
 of
x
.

The
@increment_dsd_offset
 operation at each loop iteration increments

A_dsd
 to reference the next column of
A
.
This builtin operation takes
A_dsd
 and creates a new DSD by offseting
its access by 1
f32
 element.

For instance, the first time this operation occurs,
A_dsd
 will now
access elements
1,

N+1,

2*N+1,

...

(M-1)*N+1
 of
A
.
Again, because
A
 is stored row major,
this will access the 1st column of
A
.

Once this loop over the
N
 columns of
A
 is complete,

y
 contains the result of
A*x
.
The
@fadds
 operation performs an elementwise vector addition between

y
 and
b
, storing the result back in
y
.
Now
y
 contains the result of
A*x

+

b
.

Using builtins to initialize tensors
¶

You may have noticed one other slight change to this code.
Instead of initializing
x
,
b
, and
y
, in the
initialize
 function,
we make use of builtins to provide values for them at declaration:

var
 x
=

@constants
(
[
N
]
f32
,
1.0
);

var
 b
=

@constants
(
[
M
]
f32
,
2.0
);

var
 y
=

@zeros
(
[
M
]
f32
);

The
@constants
 builtin returns a tensor of the specified type,
with all elements initialized to the specified value.
Thus,
x
 is initialized as an
N
 element tensor of all ones,
and
b
 is initialized as an
M
 element tensor of all twos.

The
@zeros
 builtin is rather obvious.
y
 is initialized as an
M

element tensor of all zeros.

Compiling and running the program
¶

As with the previous tutorial, we compile and run this code using:

$ cslc layout.csl --fabric-dims
=
8
,3 --fabric-offsets
=
4
,1 --memcpy --channels
=
1
 -o out
$ cs_python run.py --name out

You should see a
SUCCESS!
 message at the end of execution.

Exercises
¶

A
 is stored row-major in the above code.
How would you rewrite
A_dsd
 and the
gemv
 function
if
A
 were stored column major instead?

Next
¶

In the next tutorial, we’ll introduce host-to-device
memcpy
,
and copy host-initialized values for
A
,
x
, and
b
 onto
the device.
